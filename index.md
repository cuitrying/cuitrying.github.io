## Welcome to My GitHub Page

Hey there!

I'm Jizhong Cui, originally from China and now enjoying life in Finland.

I'm a first-year master's student, diving into the world of computer science at the University of Helsinki.

As for my interests, right now, I'm really into machine learning, compression techniques, and privacy protection. Still exploring and excited to see where these passions take me!
